*Purpose*: Creating effective data visualizations is an *iterative*
process; very rarely will the first graph you make be the most
effective. The most effective thing you can do to be successful in this
iterative process is to *try multiple graphs* of the same data.

Furthermore, judging the effectiveness of a visual is completely
dependent on *the question you are trying to answer*. A visual that is
totally ineffective for one question may be perfect for answering a
different question.

In this challenge, you will practice *iterating* on data visualization,
and will anchor the *assessment* of your visuals using two different
questions.

*Note*: Please complete your initial visual design **alone**. Work on
both of your graphs alone, and save a version to your repo *before*
coming together with your team. This way you can all bring a diversity
of ideas to the table!

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Due Date

<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due **at midnight**
before the day of the class discussion of the challenge. See the
[Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeP6DUS8Djq_A0HMllMqsSqX3a9dbcx1/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110386251748498665069&rtpof=true&sd=true)

*Background*: The data[1] we study in this challenge report the
[*minimum inhibitory
concentration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration)
(MIC) of three drugs for different bacteria. The smaller the MIC for a
given drug and bacteria pair, the more practical the drug is for
treating that particular bacteria. An MIC value of *at most* 0.1 is
considered necessary for treating human patients.

These data report MIC values for three antibiotics---penicillin,
streptomycin, and neomycin---on 16 bacteria. Bacteria are categorized
into a genus based on a number of features, including their resistance
to antibiotics.

```

# Visualization

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Prototype 5 visuals

To start, construct **5 qualitatively different visualizations of the
data** `df_antibiotics`. These **cannot** be simple variations on the
same graph; for instance, if two of your visuals could be made identical
by calling `coord_flip()`, then these are *not* qualitatively different.

For all five of the visuals, you must show information on *all 16
bacteria*. For the first two visuals, you must *show all variables*.

*Hint 1*: Try working quickly on this part; come up with a bunch of
ideas, and don't fixate on any one idea for too long. You will have a
chance to refine later in this challenge.

*Hint 2*: The data `df_antibiotics` are in a *wide* format; it may be
helpful to `pivot_longer()` the data to make certain visuals easier to
construct.

#### Visual 1 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

```{r q1.1}
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = penicillin, size = neomycin , y = streptomycin, color = bacteria, shape = gram))+
  geom_point() 
```

#### Visual 2 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

df_antibiotics %\>%

ggplot(aes(x = gram , y = "effectiveness", color = bacteria, shape =
"medicine" ))+

geom_point()

```{r q1.2}
piv_anti <- df_antibiotics  %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "medicine",
    values_to = "effectiveness",
    cols = c(neomycin, penicillin, streptomycin)
  )
  # I tried for wayyy too long to chop up the string to make all of the
  # bacteria readable; will come back if I have time.
  # ) %>%
  # mutate(bacteria = substring(bacteria,0,3))

piv_anti

piv_anti %>%
  ggplot(aes(x =effectiveness , y =bacteria, color = gram, shape = medicine ))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_minimal()
  # theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
```

#### Visual 3 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

```{r q1.3}
df_antibiotics %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "medicine",
    values_to = "effectiveness",
    cols = c(neomycin, penicillin, streptomycin)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = medicine, x = effectiveness, y = bacteria)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + 
  scale_x_log10()
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
```

#### Visual 4 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

```{r q1.4}

df_antibiotics %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "medicine",
    values_to = "effectiveness",
    cols = c(neomycin, penicillin, streptomycin)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = effectiveness, y = bacteria)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  scale_x_log10()

# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
```

#### Visual 5 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

```{r q1.5}
piv_anti %>%
  group_by(medicine, gram) %>%
  summarize(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ggplot(aes (x = medicine, y = count, fill = gram))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal()
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
```

### **q2** Assess your visuals

There are **two questions** below; use your five visuals to help answer
both Guiding Questions. Note that you must also identify which of your
five visuals were most helpful in answering the questions.

*Hint 1*: It's possible that *none* of your visuals is effective in
answering the questions below. You may need to revise one or more of
your visuals to answer the questions below!

*Hint 2*: It's **highly unlikely** that the same visual is the most
effective at helping answer both guiding questions. **Use this as an
opportunity to think about why this is.**

#### Guiding Question 1

> How do the three antibiotics vary in their effectiveness against
> bacteria of different genera and Gram stain?

*Observations* - What is your response to the question above? -

Neomycin is least effective in treating Diplococcus pneumonia and
streptococcus hemolyticus and viridans; it also shows most effectiveness in treating negative gram bacteria.

Penicillin is least effective in treating bacteria not of the
streptococcus, bacillus, and diplococcus genera and generally shows
the most effectiveness in treating positive gram bacteria.

Streptomycin is least effective in treating bacteria of the streptococcus
genera, as well as diplococcus pneumonia. It seems to work most
effectively in negative gram bacteria.

(Write your response here) - Which of your visuals above (1 through 5)
is **most effective** at helping to answer this question? - (Write your
response here) - Why? - (Write your response here)

Visuals 1 and 3 were the ones I primarily relied on, because 3 displayed
their treatment effectiveness based upon bacteria type and 1 was my best
graph for comparing that to gram. However, as a whole, I would say my
first visual is the weakest visual I produced -- it's really hard to
tell what's going on.

#### Guiding Question 2

In 1974 *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus pneumoniae*,
and in 1984 *Streptococcus fecalis* was renamed *Enterococcus fecalis*
[2].

> Why was *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus
> pneumoniae*?

*Observations* - What is your response to the question above? - (Write
your response here) - Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is
**most effective** at helping to answer this question? - (Write your
response here) - Why? - (Write your response here)

It trends very similarly with the other streptococcus bacteria, though
I'm not sure if that's the only factor that scientists would care about
in renaming its genera. For instance, penicillin is weak against
streptococcus and diplococcus, while streptomycin is strong against
both, leading me to believe there's something about the makeup of both
bacteria that is similar enough that the same medicine has the same
effects on both. Visual 5 is the most effective at answering this
question because it displays each of the bacterias' relationship to
different medicines very clearly.
