*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- Class, Sex, Age, Survived, n

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here
- Are there any differences?
  - Yes. Wikipedia says that there were 2224 passengers and crew aboard
    the titanic, but the dataset only includes 2201 people.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - These differences might come from unidentifiable bodies that didn’t
    posses the necessary categories to be included in the dataset.
    Alternatively, there may have been a few people who for some reason
    or another were unable to make the Titanic’s voyage after purchasing
    a ticket. Additionally, there may have been people who were
    travelling under aliases or whose names were lost. It’s difficult to
    say which one is *more* accurate, since both of our datasets merely
    try to estimate the number of folks aboard the Titanic.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex))
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- The number of female passengers saved far outnumbers the number of
  males saved in 1st and 2nd class, are roughly equal in 3rd and swing
  drastically in the male direction for crew. Now, raw numerical data
  like this rarely ever a helpful statistic to utilize in drawing
  conclusions like this, because, for instance, the high male survival
  rate in crew could be indicative of the crew being a majority male,
  not men running to the front of the line.
- Based upon this biased visualization of the data, I’m tempted to draw
  conclusions like “the men in 1st and 2nd class were taught this
  concept of ‘chivalry’ and so sacrificed themselves so a higher
  proportion of women would survive…” which is dangerous to do without a
  more accurate look into what biases I may or may not have considered.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`position_stack()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- Write your observations here.

  It appears that the *proportion* of female passengers that survived is
  much higher than the proportion of male passengers for 3rd class and
  crew, even though the previous graph would tell you nothing of the
  sort.

- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?

  The whole thing reeks of salmon and tuna. Mainly, it says that over 1
  (100%) of men in first class and around 200% of the women in first
  class were rescued. That immediately strikes me as odd, because that’s
  simply impossible; there’s clearly another variable here that’s
  affecting the scale of the proportion that isn’t visualized in this
  graph.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_col(aes(x = Class, y = Prop, fill = Sex), position = "dodge") +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(Age))
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- (Write your observations here.)

First, there were no children who were crew members (or none of them
survived, but we’re simply going to assume that no children were crew
members because I want to retain some of my faith in humanity). Knowing
what I know about child labor in the early 1900s, I think that’s a
surprisingly good sign. Secondly, 100% of first and second class
*children* were saved; that make sense, given that children were ordered
onto the lifeboats before adults were able to get on them. Finally, It
appears that prioritizing children kind of went out of the window when
it came to 3rd class. It seemed like a borderline free-for-all, the way
both of the columns indicate how few people survived. I mean, the rich
*literally paid* for their (children’s) lives.

- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.

The reason why over 100% of men and women were getting saved is because
we were lumping together adults and children, thus bringing up the total
number of “men” and “women” considerably. Once we factor that out, every
percentage actually appears to be capped out at 100%, which is much more
understandable for the average reader.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
